The Berkeley Innovation Index (BII) was created at UC Berkeley's Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship & technology (SCET). In cooperation with industry professionals, BII has been developed to offer simple yet powerful ways to measure something never before measurable: An individual's innovative mindset level, by relating it to traits linked to individual innovation capability.
